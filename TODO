Waf 1.6.x
---------

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS

- easy project relocation (change the top directory in the pickle file)
- put the targets in the build directory even though they seem to be in the source directory
- osx applications

- better apis for shell compilation in Task.py + consistency with Utils.subst_vars
- python 2.3 fixes for msvc.py and fc.py: sort(key=fun)
- synchronized stdout+stderr for all commands by default

LOW PRIORITY (contributions will be welcome)

+ IDE file generator (msvc, codeblocks)?
+ CMake file interpreter?
